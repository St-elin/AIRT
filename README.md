# AIRT - Another (attribution?) Incident Response Tool

## Why?

Let's imagine you have a huge incident and you are sure that it is an APT case. You can just create a json layer of TTPs and let the the script make a simple attribution for you. In current release script will get you the top 10 likely related APTs to your case after layer submition.

## What am I have to do to make this work?

 - python3
 - pip3 install requests stix2 (prefer to use virtualenv)
 - web-accessible json layer

## Simple Example
